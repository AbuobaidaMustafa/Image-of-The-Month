 <li><a href="http://bothofus.abuobaida.sd/" blank>web front page</a></li>
    </ul>
 <br>
 <p>the Thinking process started by dividing the task to two parts:
   <ol type="1">
   <li>BackEnd (Admin Panel).</li>
    <li>FrontEnd (The simple web page that show list of images).</li>
       </ol>
In addition,I selected the framework that prefered and suggested in the Task description which is Laravel.It has lots of options for making admin panels some of them are scaffolding and others need some effort to stand up.After choosing the task and according to the requirements I made the decision to use Orchid which is open source and flexible to be suitable for such project.</p><br>
<p>The assignment was good start project , and it tests the core fundamentals.The idea was clear as well as well documented and the process of submit is intriguing. </p>
<p>The challenging thing in the task as all was to choose Orchid Admin Panel,which it is my first time to use and the syntax is quite different from the pure Laravel and it has also some quite different concepts of working such as screens and Layouts,so I was reading documentation and practicing in the same time.</p>

<p>I followed the Orchid Admin Panel Concepts which a great starting point to develop a sense for whatâ€™s good code</p>
